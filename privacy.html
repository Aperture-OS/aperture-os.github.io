      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and

        <li>
          <p>
            If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
            compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and
            the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
            breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a

      <h2 id="DNT">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting
        you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
        DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
        DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
        Notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
        DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
        standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to
        them at this time.

        Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an
        authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request

      </p>
      <h3>Request Verification</h3>
      <p>

        request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
        However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
        maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information
        for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
        fraud-prevention purposes.

        If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to
        collect additional information to verify your identity before processing
        your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed
        permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.

        response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons
        for the decisions. If your appeal is denied, you may submit a complaint
